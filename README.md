# ACS2330-Wireframe-homework

### Introduction

The goal of the assignment is to create wireframes for the SFPOPOS site we built during the react tutorial. As part of that tutorial, I built a page to present the public open spaces in Cameroon. As such I will adjust the homework prompts to my version of SFPOPOS site which I called 'Discover Cameroon'. 

### Step 1. Write three user stories for the site: 

- As a user, I would like to find out what are places that I can visit as a tourist in Cameroon. 
- As a user, I would like to know the hours of the public spaces as well as their location so that I can plan a visit accordingly.
- As a user, I would like to see images of the available spaces to help me decide which ones I like the most.

### Step 2. Make an outline:
